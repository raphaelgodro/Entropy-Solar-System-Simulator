# Solar System Simulator - Gods Sandbox

Developers :

##About the project
This is a program made for a final school project in CEGEP (equivalent of Senior year in US High School).
Coded in Java, developed with Netbeans IDE.

The solar system simulator is simulating our solar system in 2D based on Newton's astrodynamical laws.
For now, our application only simulates our solar system but we want to synchronized it with every solar system found by human kind from Kepler and other various methods. Those database are available in the nasa database and its our next step to join them.
There is interest on such a project for educational purpose, based on the fact that we made an interactive mode in which we can control a spaceship, change the characteristics of an object etc. We can also create a planet,star,satellite and even a whole solar system.

Now this project goes public, if it has any interest for some of you guys, we're open !
